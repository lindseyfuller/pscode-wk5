Print "The average is"
Set avg to (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5
Print avg

If (n1<n2)
	Set max to n2
Else
	Set max to n1
If (n3>max)
	Set max to n3
If (n4>max)
	Set max to n4
If (n5>max)
	Set max to n5
Print "The maximum number is"
Print max

If (n1>n2)
	Set min to n2
Else
	Set min to n1
If (n3<min)
	Set min to n3
If (n4<min)
	Set min to n4
If (n5<min)
	Set min to n5
Print "The minimum number is"
Print min
